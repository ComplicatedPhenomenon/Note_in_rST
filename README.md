`sphinx_bootstrap_theme` requirements:
* [Sphinx 1.7.6](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
* [sphinx_bootstrap_theme](https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme)

As `sphinx_bootstrap_theme` is not a built-in theme for  `ReadtheDocs`, in order to view the documentation on `ReadtheDocs`, you need to either add the theme locally in your project or setup the advanced setting in `ReadtheDocs`.

For a more detailed customized usage guide, you can visit the [official guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_installs/customization.html).

Now I think `sphinx_rtd_theme` is better.

An urgent problem about **how to manage the downloaded article** has long plagued me.
