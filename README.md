`sphinx_bootstrap_theme`Requirements:
* [Sphinx 1.7.6](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
* [sphinx_bootstrap_theme](https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme)

For ReadtheDocs sake, you either add the theme locally in your original file,
or setup the advanced setting in ReadtheDocs.
* [Customize install](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/custom_installs/customization.html).

Now I think `sphinx_rtd_theme` is better.

An urgent problem about **how to manage the downloaded article** has long plagued me.
