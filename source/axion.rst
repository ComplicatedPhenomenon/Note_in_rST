    If you could see gamma-rays, the night sky would look strange and unfamiliar. The familiar sights of constantly shining stars and galaxies would be replaced by something ever-changing. Your gamma-ray vision would peer into the hearts of solar flares, supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and active galaxies. Gamma-ray astronomy presents unique opportunities to explore these exotic objects.

       Explanation: Situated over 2,000,000,000 (two billion) light-years from Earth, galaxies in cluster Abell 2390 (top) and MS2137.3-2353 (bottom) are seen in the right hand panels above, false-color images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Corresponding panels on the left reveal each cluster's x-ray appearance in images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. While the Hubble images record the cluster's star-filled galaxies, the x-ray images show no galaxies at all ... only multi-million degree hot intracluster gas which glows in high energy x-rays. But there lies a profound mystery. The total mass in the galaxies on the right, plus the mass of the hot gas on the left, falls far short of providing enough gravity to confine the hot gas within the galaxy clusters. In fact, the best accounting to date can only find 13 per cent (!) of the total matter necessary. Gravitational lens arcs visible in the deep Hubble images also indicate these clusters have much more mass than directly identifiable in the Chandra and Hubble data. Astronomers conclude that most of the cluster matter is dark matter, invisible even to the combined far-seeing eyes of these orbiting astrophysical observatories. What is the nature of this cosmic dark matter?

Two-Photon physics in Astronomy
``````````````````````````````````

Photon–photon scattering limits the spectrum of observed gammas to a photon energy below 80 TeV, that is, a wavelength of more than ~ :math:`1.5×10^{−20}` m. The other photon is one of the many photons of the cosmic microwave background. In the frame of reference where the invariant mass of the two photons is at rest, both photons are gammas with just enough energy to pair-produce an electron–positron pair.

The electrons and positrons produced in the interaction with EBL photons do not reach earth, however, they can scatter off photons of the CMB. This transfer energy from the pairs to the CMB photons, transforming them to gamma rays with lower energies than the inertia parent gamma ray.

The deflection of electron/positron pairs in the intergalactic magnetic field can lead to observable effects, including

- a time dispersion
- spectral signatures
- as well as an apparent extension.

Basic question
```````````````
1 Where is the center of the universe?

Where is the actual center of the Universe, regardless of who’s observing it? Our Universe might be finite or it might be infinite. Astronomers don’t actually know for sure. Their most precise calculations say that the observable Universe is 93 billion light years across.

Remember that light from the Big Bang that took 13.8 billion light years to get to you? Well the expansion of the Universe has pushed that region out to more than 46 billion light-years away. Look as far as you can to the right and as far as you can to the left. Those two spots are currently 93 billion light-years away from each other. So we can’t see how big the Universe really is. It’s got to be larger than 93 billion light-years. Everything outside that region we just can’t see… yet. It might be infinite.

2 The universe is accelerating expanding. Everything toward us go through an redshift, so the VHE gamma ray must have bigger energy than we observed on earth.

3 The origin of intergalatic magnetic field.

PROPAGATION OF HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS IN THE UNIVERSE
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Gamma rays do not traverse the Universe unperturbed. They can interact with background radiation such as the EBL. The EBL consists of the starlight emitted over the entire history of the Universe and the starlight that has been absorbed and re-emitted by dust. If a gamma-ray interacts with an EBL photon, it produces a pair of one electron and its anti-particle, the positron. Just like clouds block the sunlight, the EBL can partially block gamma rays from reaching us. Using a certain type of galaxies, so called blazars, as cosmic beacons of gamma rays, we can study the EBL and eventually the formation of stars during the history of the Universe. Much more about the EBL will be learned with future CTA observations. Check out the article "What the Propagation of Energetic Light Can tell us About the Evolution of Stars, Intergalactic Magnetic Fields and Fundamental Physics" in the CTA newsletter for further information.

INTERGALACTIC MAGNETIC FIELDS
````````````````````````````````
The electron-positron pair discussed above can again scatter photons of the cosmic microwave background, boosting them to gamma-ray energies. These gamma rays can again interact with the EBL and create a chain reaction of produced electrons and positrons and gamma rays. Since electrons and positrons are charged, they are deflected by magnetic fields. If the IGMF is sufficiently strong, the gamma rays in the cascade arrive delayed from the primary gamma rays and blazars would appear extended in the gamma-ray sky. I use observations of the Fermi-LAT satellite and imaging Cherenkov Telescopes to search for such features, and I have derived projections for CTA to look for the cascade gamma rays.
