    If you could see gamma-rays, the night sky would look strange and unfamiliar. The familiar sights of constantly shining stars and galaxies would be replaced by something ever-changing. Your gamma-ray vision would peer into the hearts of solar flares, supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and active galaxies. Gamma-ray astronomy presents unique opportunities to explore these exotic objects.

Basic question
```````````````
1 Where is the center of the universe?

  Where is the actual center of the Universe, regardless of who’s observing it? Our Universe might be finite or it might be infinite. Astronomers don’t actually know for sure. Their most precise calculations say that the observable Universe is 93 billion light years across.

  Remember that light from the Big Bang that took 13.8 billion light years to get to you? Well the expansion of the Universe has pushed that region out to more than 46 billion light-years away. Look as far as you can to the right and as far as you can to the left. Those two spots are currently 93 billion light-years away from each other. So we can’t see how big the Universe really is. It’s got to be larger than 93 billion light-years. Everything outside that region we just can’t see… yet. It might be infinite.

2 The universe is accelerating expanding. Everything toward us go through an redshift, so the VHE gamma ray must have bigger energy than we observed on earth.

3 The origin of intergalatic magnetic field.

4 what propogation of energetic light can tell us?

  Photons at energies beyond a billion times that of X-rays cannot reach us from the outer edges of the observable Universe. Only a fraction of these very-high-energy gamma rays reach our atmosphere to produce firework-like visual displays called air showers. While our eyes can’t see these rapid air showers, telescopes can. Today, the H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS telescopes observe gamma rays and tell us the story of their travels, taking nano-second pictures of the fireworks they initiate in the atmosphere. In the not-too-distant future, CTA will measure these gamma rays with its improved sensitivity and will write down the chronicles of gamma-ray propagation on cosmological scales.

     Fig. 1: Cosmic journey of gamma rays from a distant galaxy down to the CTA Observatory. Some gamma rays produce electron-positron pairs when interacting with EGBL photons (red). The pairs, deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field, scatter off CMB photons resulting in a gamma-ray halo (orange). Exotic processes such as Lorentz invariance violation (gray) or coupling to axion-like particles (light blue) could modify the absorption, resulting in characteristic spectral features.


  Gamma rays are emitted in distant galaxies located billions of light years away. The chief foe that gamma rays face in the intergalactic medium is the army of lower-energy photons called the extragalactic background light (EGBL). The EGBL radiation spans the ultraviolet, optical and infrared bands and is created mainly by stars and dust in galaxies over the history of the Universe. EGBL photons interact with gamma rays to generate pairs of electrons and positrons. This absorption, depicted in Fig. 1 (red box), becomes stronger with increasing gamma-ray energy and source distance. By measuring it in gamma-ray spectra of extragalactic sources, CTA will probe with unrivaled accuracy the spectrum and evolution of the EGBL, thereby unveiling the formation and evolution of dust and stars in galaxies.

  The electrons and positrons produced in the interaction with EGBL photons do not reach Earth, however, they can scatter off photons of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This transfers energy from the pairs to the CMB photons, transforming them to gamma rays with lower energies than that of the initial parent gamma ray, as shown in Fig. 1 (orange box). Because electrons and positrons are charged particles, they are affected by the intergalactic magnetic field in cosmic voids, which deflects their trajectory on scales of millions of light years. This creates a diffuse gamma-ray halo around otherwise point-like sources. CTA will search for such halos, and possibly detect for the first time the elusive remnant of cosmic magnetism in the most rarefied corners of the Universe.

  In their struggle for survival, gamma rays could be helped by new processes, which lie beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology. The first is Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) at the Planck scale, the frontier of current physical theories. This process could shield gamma rays from interacting with the EGBL, resulting in an unexpectedly large number of cosmic-trotters reaching Earth at the highest energies probed by CTA (Fig. 1, gray box). The second is a cloak called an axion-like particle. Gamma rays could put this cloak on within magnetic fields, effectively escaping interactions with the EGBL. Cloaked-uncloaked oscillations (Fig. 1, light blue box) would result in larger-than-expected fluctuations in the gamma-ray spectra, which CTA will constrain with its excellent energy reconstruction.

  Gamma rays from extragalactic sources tell us the story of an epic cosmic journey, probing the very fabric and content of the Universe in large voids. A first report of the potential of CTA to constrain gamma-ray propagation can be found in [1], but the CTA Consortium is actively preparing the scientific machinery to greet cosmic-trotters and recount their odyssey.


PROPAGATION OF HIGH ENERGY PHOTONS IN THE UNIVERSE
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Gamma rays do not traverse the Universe unperturbed. They can interact with background radiation such as the EGBL. The EGBL consists of the starlight emitted over the entire history of the Universe and the starlight that has been absorbed and re-emitted by dust. If a gamma-ray interacts with an EGBL photon, it produces a pair of one electron and its anti-particle, the positron. Just like clouds block the sunlight, the EGBL can partially block gamma rays from reaching us. Using a certain type of galaxies, so called blazars, as cosmic beacons of gamma rays, we can study the EGBL and eventually the formation of stars during the history of the Universe. Much more about the EGBL will be learned with future CTA observations. Check out the article "What the Propagation of Energetic Light Can tell us About the Evolution of Stars, Intergalactic Magnetic Fields and Fundamental Physics" in the CTA newsletter for further information.

INTERGALACTIC MAGNETIC FIELDS
````````````````````````````````
The electron-positron pair discussed above can again scatter photons of the cosmic microwave background, boosting them to gamma-ray energies. These gamma rays can again interact with the EGBL and create a chain reaction of produced electrons and positrons and gamma rays. Since electrons and positrons are charged, they are deflected by magnetic fields. If the IGMF is sufficiently strong, the gamma rays in the cascade arrive delayed from the primary gamma rays and blazars would appear extended in the gamma-ray sky. I use observations of the Fermi-LAT satellite and imaging Cherenkov Telescopes to search for such features, and I have derived projections for CTA to look for the cascade gamma rays.


Two-Photon physics in Astronomy
``````````````````````````````````
Photon–photon scattering limits the spectrum of observed gammas to a photon energy below 80 TeV, that is, a wavelength of more than ~ :math:`1.5×10^{−20}` m. The other photon is one of the many photons of the cosmic microwave background. In the frame of reference where the invariant mass of the two photons is at rest, both photons are gammas with just enough energy to pair-produce an electron–positron pair.

The electrons and positrons produced in the interaction with EGBL photons do not reach earth, however, they can scatter off photons of the CMB. This transfer energy from the pairs to the CMB photons, transforming them to gamma rays with lower energies than the inertia parent gamma ray.

The deflection of electron/positron pairs in the intergalactic magnetic field can lead to observable effects, including

  - a time dispersion
  - spectral signatures
  - as well as an apparent extension.
