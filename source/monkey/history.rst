`A story about gamma ray astronomy <https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/gamma_ray_astronomy1.html>`_

    If you could see gamma-rays, the night sky would look strange and unfamiliar.
    The familiar sights of constantly shining stars and galaxies would be replaced
    by something ever-changing. Your gamma-ray vision would peer into the hearts
    of solar flares, supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and active galaxies.
    ßGamma-ray astronomy presents unique opportunities to explore these exotic objects.

Phenomenology

Gamma ray induced cascade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations of three-dimensional
electromagnetic cascade initiated by interactions of the multi-TeV γ rays with
the cosmological infrared/optical photon background in the intergalactic medium.

Gamma ray sources are still not entirely freed from the influence of the EGMF.
VHE gamma rays can interact with background photons through the pair production
interaction :math:`\gamma_{VHE}` + :math:`\gamma_b` → :math:`e^+` + :math:`e^-` .
If the initial gamma ray was energetic enough, both the electron and positron
produced can transfer their energy on to additional background photons through
inverse Compton scattering e + :math:`\gamma_b` → :math:`\gamma_{VHE}` + e'  .
If the initial gamma ray was of particularly high energy, this process can carry
on and results in a single VHE gamma ray producing a multitude of high energy
photons. This process is called an electromagnetic cascade.

.. [1] CTA will be ten times more sensitive and have unprecedented accuracy in
       its detection of high-energy gamma rays
