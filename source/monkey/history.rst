    If you could see gamma-rays, the night sky would look strange and unfamiliar.
    The familiar sights of constantly shining stars and galaxies would be replaced
    by something ever-changing. Your gamma-ray vision would peer into the hearts
    of solar flares, supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and active galaxies.
    Gamma-ray astronomy presents unique opportunities to explore these exotic objects.

Cosmological redshift
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are three main causes of red and blue shifts in astronomy and cosmology
- Doppler redshift
- Cosmological redshift
- Gravitational redshift

It is customary to refer to this change using a dimensionless quantity called z

.. math::

   1+z = \frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{obsv}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{emit}}}

.. math::

   1+z = \frac{f_{\mathrm{emit}}}{f_{\mathrm{obsv}}}

.. math::

  1+z = \frac{a_{\mathrm{now}}}{a_{\mathrm{then}}}

:math:`a` is the scale factor. In an expanding universe such as the one we inhabit, the scale factor is monotonically increasing as time passes, thus, z is positive and distant galaxies appear redshifted.

Phenomenology
--------------
Basic concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- What is a Cherenkov Process?

An excellent account of the work of Mallet and
of Cherenkov and of the interpretation of Cherenkov's observations by Frank and Tamm, together with extensive details about applications of the radiation, has been given by Jelley.

So what did Frank and Tamm do? They made interpretation to experiment runned by  Cherenkov.

Gamma ray induced cascade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations of three-dimensional
electromagnetic cascade initiated by interactions of the multi-TeV γ rays with
the cosmological infrared/optical photon background in the intergalactic medium.

That is to say, gamma ray sources are still not entirely freed from the influence
of the EGMF. VHE gamma rays can interact with background photons through the pair
production interaction :math:`\gamma_{VHE}` + :math:`\gamma_b` → :math:`e^+` +
:math:`e^-`. If the initial gamma ray was energetic enough, both the electron
and positron produced can transfer their energy on to additional background
photons through inverse Compton scattering e + :math:`\gamma_b` →
:math:`\gamma_{VHE}` + :math:`e'` . If the initial gamma ray was of particularly high
energy, this process can carry on and results in a single VHE gamma ray
producing a multitude of high energy photons. This process is called an
electromagnetic cascade.

Detail of process as much as possible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Gamma ray source

- Active Galaxy Nuclei

  It's like a powerful? beam of laser
- Pulsars

  Regularly receive its signal from earth.

The universe is opaque for gamma rays in the VHE range. Photon absorption in the
intergalactic photon background is energy dependent and starts to become substantial
at :math:`\mathrm{TeV}` energies. (Better to place a clear calculation here, show the
final formula and explain it)

The cascade process make initial VHE photons into photons of lower energies which
can travel further. (Is the universe transparent to the lower energies photons? Yes, that's why
we can see the CMB until now.)

Moreover, depending on the intensity of the IGMF, the bending effect on the electron positron
pair trajectories can result into different emission scenarios. For a strong IGMF intensity
synchrotron cooling would become dominant and no secondary gamma ray would be produced, this
scenario has been ruled out for Mpc scale IGMF by the non-observation of Faraday rotation.
For a more moderate IGMF. the pair trajectories also are isotropized around the source
eventually give rise to an extended isotropic emission of photons, or halo.

How do we simulate the process of electromagnetic cascade?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We simulate the delay time :math:`\delta t` and deflection angle :math:`\delta
\theta` with respect to energy of original gamma photon using the open source
Monte Carlo code.


Here need large amount of words to explain this figure.

:math:`D_{IC}` refers to the distance of Inverse Compton process. Put it in
another way, it means until the electrons(here electron both electron and
positron) cool down, the distance it travels.

According to the , :math:`D_{IC}` must be small, to understand it intuitively,

.. math::

   D_{IC} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{4\sigma_T u_{CMB}\gamma}\approx 0.7(\frac{E}
   {\mathrm{TeV}})^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}
