The Correlation length of EGMF.
`````````````````````````````````
when the primary VHE gamma photon interact with EBL, the length it went through.
Before the pair being deflected by IGMF, the pairs won't go along the direction
primary photon.

Methods to measure the distance between earth and an object.

How to set lower limit and upper limit of EGMF?

Does the sun emit gamma photons?
````````````````````````````````
The sun must emits HE gamma ray photon. The background is essentially opaque to
this kind of gamma photon. Better to testify the assumption in a qualitative way.
Or to find the work done before in the case you are not familiar with the computation
in detail.

Gamma ray source.

These VHE photons have energies between 100 GeV to 10 TeV and are produces by
extraordinary astrophysical process or by forces beyond the SM(It's such a bald
hypothesis).

From source to detector, ignore (IGBL) the medium between.  a part of light will
directly arrive at earth, and probed by detector, like sun emits light and the
sky is bright. Since there exists IGBL, part of the light can make to
arrive at earth.


Some of them will travel to earth without scattering which will give you access
to intrinsic spectrum of the source so what is producing at the source. some of
them are going to scatter EBL that they encounter on the way to earth.

Time delay of the two photons undergo different situation.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
.. math::

   \frac{dN}{dE}=E^{\Gamma}

If the VHE pairs didn't scatter with photons of CMB and travel to earth, how do
we discriminate it with  VHE photons. Will it initiate EM cascade? If we are not
able to differentiate them, what reason do we have to ignore the noise.


“High-energy gamma rays can be produced either by accelerated electrons or protons.
The observation of a neutrino, which is a hallmark of proton interactions, is the
first definitive evidence of proton acceleration by black holes.”

Think over the `CMB`_ and Big Bang
-----------------------------------
.. _CMB: https://www.space.com/20330-cosmic-microwave-background-explained-infographic.html

From Quora::

  The origination of the big bang may have been point-like, but that says nothing
  about there being a "direction" of the big bang. Every point in space come from
  the big bang point of the origin.

  The CMB was formed when the universe cooled to a point that free electrons and
  protons could combine to form neutral hydrogen. This allowed light to travel for
  great distances without being scattered. This happened everywhere in the observable
  universe at roughly the same time, which explain why we see the CMB in every direction.
  We are continually receiving photons that begin to stream uninterrupted from points
  in space that are increasingly farther away.

  If every point in a finitely boundless space begin to expand outwards it would
  result in the same scenario.

What it means to the light is absorbed?

How well do I know about these stuff?
-----------------------------------------
I am supposed to know the actual process of doing computation in the astrophysical
area, I come out with none about what exactly I need to do, the deflected angle
between primordial and observed light. the time delation, according to the

Some one said don't place the cart before the horse, and don't place the answer
before the question, I think about the problems, I don't know exactly the logics
behind the big problems. I apply the possible approach to find out something.

By making your assumptions as well as your hypotheses explicit you increase the
clarity of your approach and the chance for learning.
