These VHE photons have energies between 100 GeV to 10 TeV and are produces by
extraordinary astrophysical process or by forces beyond the SM(It's such a bald
hypothesis).

From source to detector, ignore (IGBL) the medium between.  a part of light will
directly arrive at earth, and probed by detector, like sun emits light and the
sky is bright. Since there exists IGBL, part of the light can make to
arrive at earth.


Some of them will travel to earth without scattering which will give you access
to intrinsic spectrum of the source so what is producing at the source. some of
them are going to scatter EBL that they encounter on the way to earth.

If the VHE pairs didn't scatter with photons of CMB and travel to earth, how do
we discriminate it with  VHE photons. Will it initiate EM cascade? If we are not
able to differentiate them, what reason do we have to ignore the noise.


“High-energy gamma rays can be produced either by accelerated electrons or protons.
The observation of a neutrino, which is a hallmark of proton interactions, is the
first definitive evidence of proton acceleration by black holes.”

Think over the `CMB`_ and Big Bang
-----------------------------------
.. _CMB: https://www.space.com/20330-cosmic-microwave-background-explained-infographic.html

.. topic:: From Quora:

  The origination of the big bang may have been point-like, but that says nothing
  about there being a "direction" of the big bang. Every point in space come from
  the big bang point of the origin.

  The CMB was formed when the universe cooled to a point that free electrons and
  protons could combine to form neutral hydrogen. This allowed light to travel for
  great distances without being scattered. This happened everywhere in the
  observable universe at roughly the same time, which explain why we see the CMB
  in every direction. We are continually receiving photons that begin to stream
  uninterrupted from points in space that are increasingly farther away.

  If every point in a finitely boundless space begin to expand outwards it would
  result in the same scenario.


What is large scale structure?

Primordial magnetic fields in the voids of LSS.

How well do I know the whole facts ?
-----------------------------------------
I am supposed to know the actual process of doing computation in the astrophysical
area, I come out with none about what exactly I need to do, the deflected angle
between primordial and observed light. the time delation, according to the

Some one said don't place the cart before the horse, and don't place the answer
before the question, I think about the problems, I don't know exactly the logics
behind the big problems. I apply the possible approach to find out something.

By making your assumptions as well as your hypotheses explicit you increase the
clarity of your approach and the chance for learning.

Energy Scale [1]_
------------------------
For a proton at 7 TeV, this is 99.9999991% times the speed of light

Now, keep in mind this is for **EACH** proton in two **BEAMS**, each one of them having 7 TeV, travelling through a superconductor cooled by helium, and then colliding for a sum of 14 TeV.

Each proton beam contains 2,808 'bunches' of protons, and each 'bunch' contains :math:`1.15 \times 10^{11}`` protons, so each beam then consists of 362 MJ (Megajoules).

This gives a total kinetic energy of 724 MJ just in the beams alone: about 7 times the kinetic energy as landing a 55 tonne aircraft at typical landing speed according to the [Joules Orders of Magnitude]  wiki page, or with that :math:`59~\mathrm{ m/s}` landing speed, 218.9 tonnes, so about a safely loaded Airbus A330-200 ([maximum takeoff weight of 242 tonnes])

Add to that the energy required to keep the ring supercooled enough so it remains superconductive, accelerate the beam in the first place, keep accelerating it so it doesn't lose velocity, light and heat and power the facility.

   At peak consumption, usually from May to mid-December, CERN uses about 200 megawatts of power, which is about a third of the amount of energy used to feed the nearby city of Geneva in Switzerland. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) runs during this period of the year, using the power to accelerate protons to nearly the speed of light. CERN's power consumption falls to about 80 megawatts during the winter months.

To get a feel about these energy unit, compare specific energy scale to the energy of usual things. Like may be the mosquito's typical energy, a running person's typical energy,
