Questions
==========
My ultimate aim
- What we will do? The problem we would try to solve.
- Why would do that ?
- Understand the context.
- Know what have been achieved.

- Correlation length.

  when the primary VHE gamma photon interact with EBL, the length it went through.
  Before the pair being deflected by IGMF, the pairs won't go along the direction primary photon.

  spectroscopy  of an object
- How to set lower limit and upper limit of EGMF?

  According to data from Fermi and HESS etc.

- Helicity of magnetic field.
- Does the sun emit gamma photons?

Gamma ray source.
These VHE photons have energies between 100 GeV to 10 TeV and are produces by
extraordinary astrophysical process or by forces beyond the SM.

From source to detector, ignore (IGBL) the medium between.  a part of light will
directly arrive at earth, and probed by detector, like sun emits light and the
sky is bright. Since there exists IGBL, part of the light can make to
arrive at earth.

We consider the

Some of them will travel to earth without scattering which will give you access
to intrinsic spectrum of the source so what is producing at the source. some of
them are going to scatter EBL that they encounter on the way to earth.

Time delay of the two photons undergo different situation.

.. math::

   \frac{dN}{dE}=E^{\Gamma}

If the VHE pairs didn't scatter with photons of CMB and travel to earth, how do
we discriminate it with  VHE photons. Will it initiate EM cascade? If we are not
able to differentiate them, what reason do we have to ignore the noise.
