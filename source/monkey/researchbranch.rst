Basic question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1 Where is the center of the universe?
````````````````````````````````````````
Where is the actual center of the Universe, regardless of who’s observing it?
Our Universe might be finite or it might be infinite. Astronomers don’t actually
know for sure. Their most precise calculations say that the observable Universe
is 93 billion light years across.

Remember that light from the Big Bang that took 13.8 billion light years to get
to you? Well the expansion of the Universe has pushed that region out to more
than 46 billion light-years away. Look as far as you can to the right and as far
as you can to the left. Those two spots are currently 93 billion light-years
away from each other. So we can’t see how big the Universe really is. It’s got
to be larger than 93 billion light-years. Everything outside that region we just
can’t see… yet. It might be infinite.

The universe is accelerating expanding. Everything toward us go through an
redshift, so the VHE gamma ray must have bigger energy than we observed on earth.

5 Propagation of high energy photons
````````````````````````````````````````
Gamma rays do not traverse the Universe unperturbed. They can interact with background radiation such as the EGBL. The EGBL consists of the starlight emitted over the entire history of the Universe and the starlight that has been absorbed and re-emitted by dust. If a gamma-ray interacts with an EGBL photon, it produces a pair of one electron and its anti-particle, the positron. Just like clouds block the sunlight, the EGBL can partially block gamma rays from reaching us. Using a certain type of galaxies, so called blazars, as cosmic beacons of gamma rays, we can study the EGBL and eventually the formation of stars during the history of the Universe. Much more about the EGBL will be learned with future CTA observations. Check out the article "What the Propagation of Energetic Light Can tell us About the Evolution of Stars, Intergalactic Magnetic Fields and Fundamental Physics" in the CTA newsletter for further information.

6 Intergalatic magnetic fields
````````````````````````````````````````
The electron-positron pair discussed above can again scatter photons of the cosmic microwave background, boosting them to gamma-ray energies. These gamma rays can again interact with the EGBL and create a chain reaction of produced electrons and positrons and gamma rays. Since electrons and positrons are charged, they are deflected by magnetic fields. If the IGMF is sufficiently strong, the gamma rays in the cascade arrive delayed from the primary gamma rays and blazars would appear extended in the gamma-ray sky. I use observations of the Fermi-LAT satellite and imaging Cherenkov Telescopes to search for such features, and I have derived projections for CTA to look for the cascade gamma rays.
