Basic question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Where is the center of the universe?
````````````````````````````````````````
Where is the actual center of the Universe, regardless of who’s observing it?
Our Universe might be finite or it might be infinite. Astronomers don’t actually
know for sure. Their most precise calculations say that the observable Universe
is 93 billion light years across.

Remember that light from the Big Bang that took 13.8 billion light years to get
to you? Well the expansion of the Universe has pushed that region out to more
than 46 billion light-years away. Look as far as you can to the right and as far
as you can to the left. Those two spots are currently 93 billion light-years
away from each other. So we can’t see how big the Universe really is. It’s got
to be larger than 93 billion light-years. Everything outside that region we just
can’t see… yet. It might be infinite.

The universe is accelerating expanding. Everything toward us go through an
redshift, so the VHE gamma ray must have bigger energy than we observed on earth.

3. The origin of intergalatic magnetic field. [1]_
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
There are several mechanism to generated primordial magnetic field. However,
these assumptions more or less rely on some unknown physics. The generation of
magnetic fields in the era of pre-recombination [2]_ has been studied
in several literature.Then this paper [1]_ study magnetogenesis in conventional physics.

It's about how magnetic fields are generated from nonlinear cosmic inhomogeneities
using the tight coupling approximation.

4. `What propagation of energetic light can tell us? <https://www.cta-observatory.org/what-propogation-of-energetic-light-can-tell-us/>`_
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The raw gamma ray can be protected(shielded) from interaction with EBL by two factors.

- LIV
- ALP

NASA got a long list of launch mission.

- Parker Solar Probe: Humanity’s First Visit to a Star

  The chief foe it will face it the extreme high temperature, but the atmosphere (known as the corona)
  of the sun got a low density. So extreme high temperature particle is rare.

  Some less familiar reason to study the sun and solar wind.

  -  It is the source of the solar wind; a flow of ionized gases from the Sun
     that streams past Earth at speeds of more than 500 km per second (a million miles per hour).
  - The solar wind also fills up much of the solar system, dominating the space
    environment far past Earth.  As we send spacecraft and astronauts further
    and further from home, we must understand this space environment just as
    early seafarers needed to understand the ocean.


5. Propagation of high energy photons
````````````````````````````````````````
Gamma rays do not traverse the Universe unperturbed. They can interact with background radiation such as the EGBL. The EGBL consists of the starlight emitted over the entire history of the Universe and the starlight that has been absorbed and re-emitted by dust. If a gamma-ray interacts with an EGBL photon, it produces a pair of one electron and its anti-particle, the positron. Just like clouds block the sunlight, the EGBL can partially block gamma rays from reaching us. Using a certain type of galaxies, so called blazars, as cosmic beacons of gamma rays, we can study the EGBL and eventually the formation of stars during the history of the Universe. Much more about the EGBL will be learned with future CTA observations. Check out the article "What the Propagation of Energetic Light Can tell us About the Evolution of Stars, Intergalactic Magnetic Fields and Fundamental Physics" in the CTA newsletter for further information.

.. [2] When the universe was younger than about 300,000 years, the temperature
  was high enough that all of the hydrogen was ionized, that is the electrons
  were free and separate from the protons. Because of the presence of the free
  electrons, photons were scattered around in all directions and could not travel
  far before changing their direction. Therefore the universe was "opaque".

  When the universe cooled to about 3000 K, the electrons and protons combined to
  form hydrogen atoms. After "recombination", photons were able to travel through
  the universe relatively unimpeded, and the universe became "transparent".
