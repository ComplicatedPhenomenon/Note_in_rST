This man's website has several highlights which I admire very much.
- Abundant original Contents constructed in a quiet simple way.
- Intelligent design

There must be a lot of useful source code written by people who eventually leave astronomy. Some if it is thus lost. It would be nice if there were a practical way to preserve such code for posterity.
