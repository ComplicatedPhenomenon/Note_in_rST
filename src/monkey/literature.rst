Literature
================

The deflection of electron/positron pairs in the intergalactic magnetic field can lead to observable effects, including

  - a time dispersion
  - spectral signatures
  - as well as an apparent extension.


.. important::

   What we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.
